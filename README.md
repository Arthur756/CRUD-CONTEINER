## PhpMyAdmin

This app is bootstrapped with VUE.js(https://vuejs.org), you can access the database of this project by [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/index.html).

## :hammer: Bootstrap

![Style!](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Bootstrap_logo.svg)

```bash
Quickly design and customize responsive mobile-first sites with Bootstrap, the worldâ€™s most popular front-end open source toolkit, featuring Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful JavaScript plugins.
```

##Installation
Install Bootstrapâ€™s source Sass and JavaScript files via npm, Composer, or Meteor.

Package managed installs donâ€™t include documentation or our full build scripts. You can also use our npm template repo to quickly generate a Bootstrap project via npm.

```bash
npm install bootstrap
```


```bash
gem install bootstrap -v 5.1.3
```
<br/>

##jsDelivr
When you only need to include Bootstrapâ€™s compiled CSS or JS, you can use jsDelivr.

See it in action with our simple starter template, or browse the examples to jumpstart your next project. You can also choose to include Popper and our JS separately.

```bash
<!-- CSS only -->
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">
```


```bash
<!-- JavaScript Bundle with Popper -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```


## System functions

All functions were built following the concept of CRUD, with respective controls. The goal of this system is register clients and their moves, but you can use to reach other targets. For those functions you can modify and add more functions for your needs.

| Functions                  | Description                                                 |    
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CREATE |  The create function in this system behaves like the register a new customer function.|
| READ  | With this function you can view all registered customers and their respective movements |
| UPDATE    |The update function allows you to edit the information of customers already registered in the database.|  
| DELETE  | The delete function allows you to delete any customer from the database.   |

For code contribution, the codebase heavily relies on functional programming principles via the [`fp-ts`](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) library. The codebase itself is quite simple, so even if you're beginner to functional programming, it shouldn't be hard to follow along. You can start with these [easy tasks](https://github.com/shootismoke/mobile-app/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
